Welcome to my Project: Elba repository
As you may have figured out by this point, this game is going to be called Pyxis
Why? Its a mix between Sixaxis and Pyro. But come to find out Pyxis is the name of a constellation.

I name everything Project before I'm ready to reveal the final game. And I name every project a town that neighbors mine,
Elba is first, so expect more in the future and you may figure out where I live.
Thats not creepy at all.

Anyway, everything related to my game is here. The concept document, the graphics, the music, the source code
Everything

If you want to mod or redo my game after I get everything out go right ahead I'm moving on.
